# About this project

The files in this repositry is my work for the Communication theory and Systems course project, which can be divided to **2** main parts:
1. Implementing Frequency Modulation (FM) using Matlab.
2. Building a Simulink model that do FM *and* use Simulink toolboxes to verify the output of the model.

For more details about the project requirements, kindly check the requirements.pdf file, and also check the project reports to take a look at what the results were.

Have a good day :)
