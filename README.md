# About this project

The files in this repositry is my work for the Communication theory and Systems course project back in 2021, which can be divided into **two** main parts:
1. Applying  Frequency Modulation (FM) to a user-generated signal using Matlab.
2. Building a Simulink model that do FM *and* use Simulink toolboxes to verify the output of the model.

For more details about the project requirements, kindly check the requirements.pdf file, and also you can check the project results in the report files.
